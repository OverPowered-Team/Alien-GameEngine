## Innovations

### Assigment 1

* Layouts: Personalized layouts that you can create, remove or edit, and save separately
* Shortcuts System: can be customized in Panel Config
* Outline: similar to Unity, parent and children different colors
* Scene inside a ImGui Window
* Docking
* Component Light
* Everything customazible at Panel Render
* Component Material Opacity and Loaded Textures Selectors
* Hierarchy System Done and Drag and Drop in Hierarchy Panel

### Assigment 2

* Control + Z (Undo)/ Control + Y (Redo): System that allows the user to go back actions made and then, if the user doesn't change the timeline, then can recover the same actions they just got back. This line is respected between the scene and the prefab scene also, so you can undo and redo actions individually between scenes and the timelines don't get lost.

* Prefabs: You can save models with all their changes in a prefab, so the user is allowed to save concrete models and presets linked to the original. You also can lock the prefab so if you change the original prefab, the locked one stays as a variant. You also can rewrite the original prefab and make the locked one the original or the inverse, make the locked one as the original. To Open the prefab and go to their particular scene the user can double-click on the file in the explorer window or open prefab in inspector or right click in hierarchy. The user can create a prefab dragging it inside the prefab folder in the explorer or its children, or making it a prefab with the right click menu.

* Explorer Window: The user can manage all folders and assets within the explorer window as they please, like create folders, delete folders and assets, reorganize folders and assets, renames, drag&drops to scene, etc.

* Scene Management: The user can load, save and create scenes with a window explorer.

* Mini Camera Preview in scene: little window in scene that appears if the user selects a game object with a camera to allow them to see how it would look in the game.

* Copy&Paste Components: You can copy a component an paste it in an existing one of the same type and all the data gets rewrited.

* Panel Game: Panel where the scene gets printed from the selected game camera view. It's independent from the scene panel so the user can visualize them at the same time.

* Light and Camera Icons in Scene: Icons that show where this components are and help in the mousepicking of them.

* Octree: To view octree, check box in the panel renderer in the octree options must be active and at least one gameobject with mesh must be static. 

### Assigment 3

* With cntrl + k or File->Build Settings user can create an automatic build for the game. Some modules and ImGui is never created.

* Intro Icon Image while opening the engine with a progress bar.

* More than 1 object is supported to be selected, cntrl to select another keeping the others. Also they can be moved/rotated/scaled or deleted and cntrl D clone them. Moving a object with shift pressed, clones it and move the clone.

* GameObjects have a tag and can be assigned in the inspector. Also there is a menu to create or remove tags. GameObjects can be find with their tag.

* There is a text editor for the scripts in the engine.

* Clone GameObjects (Cntrl + D or shift while moving gizmo)

* In the scripting, there is OnDrawGizmos and OnDrawGizmos selected, user can use the class Gizmo to draw cube, sphere, line, wire mesh...

* Maybe HotReload?
